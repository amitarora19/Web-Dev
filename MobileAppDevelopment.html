    <div><p>Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as
            personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These applications can be 
            pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or 
            client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a Web browser.
            Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and
            configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms. Mobile
            app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created. A 2013 analyst report estimates there are 
            29,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU then 28 members (including the UK), 60 percent of which are mobile app
            developer

As part of the development process, mobile user interface (UI) design is also essential in the creation of mobile apps. 
Mobile UI considers constraints, contexts, screen, input, and mobility as outlines for design. The user is often the focus of
interaction with their device, and the interface entails components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the 
users to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation. </p></div>
