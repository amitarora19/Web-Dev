Cloud Computing Services provide information technology (IT) as a service over the Internet or dedicated network, 
with delivery on demand, and payment based on usage. Cloud computing services range from full applications and development 
platforms, to servers, storage, and virtual desktops.Corporate and government entities utilize cloud computing services
to address a variety of application and infrastructure needs such as CRM, database, compute, and data storage. Unlike a 
traditional IT environment, where software and hardware are funded up front by department and implemented over a period of 
months, cloud computing services deliver IT resources in minutes to hours and align costs to actual usage. As a result,
organizations have greater agility and can manage expenses more efficiently. Similarly, consumers utilize cloud computing 
services to simplify application utilization, store, share, and protect content, and enable access from any web-connected 
device.</p></div>
